🚖 Ola Ride Insights
An end-to-end data analysis project on OLA ride-sharing data, uncovering key insights using SQL, Power BI, and a Streamlit-based dashboard.

📌 Problem Statement:
Ride-sharing platforms like OLA generate massive amounts of data. However, deriving actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business strategies remains a challenge.
This project focuses on analyzing OLA’s ride data using a business-focused approach, offering insights into ride trends, cancellations, revenue, customer behavior, and more.

📊 Tools & Technologies Used:
**SQL**: Data extraction and transformation
**Power BI**: Interactive dashboard development
**Streamlit**: Web app for visualization and insights
**Python**: Data processing & visualization
**Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Python libraries for data analysis
